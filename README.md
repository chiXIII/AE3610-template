# AE X610 Report Template

This is a LaTeX template for creating lab reports for 2610 or 3610. The formatting requirements
for these classes are very strict, and finding the right commands to get exactly what the
instructors want can be a pain. This template is intended to provide all of the necessary
formatting commands in one place.

This template meets the formatting reqirements as of Fall 2019.

Don't hesitate to share this repository with others. If you find a useful trick, or if you
need to update the formatting to satisfy newer requirements, I would welcome edits. Contact
